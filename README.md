## DESCRIPTION: The Multithreaded Chat Application is a real-time client-server communication system developed using Java, showcasing the implementation of socket programming and multithreading to facilitate simultaneous interaction among multiple users over a TCP/IP network. This project leverages Java SE Development Kit (JDK) as the core development platform, with the application designed, coded, and executed in lightweight IDEs such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA, and compiled via command-line tools like javac and executed using java. The application uses the Java.net package, which includes ServerSocket, Socket, PrintWriter, and BufferedReader classes for handling network communication and stream-based data transmission. The server component listens for incoming connections on a predefined port and spawns a new thread for each connected client, thus ensuring that multiple clients can communicate concurrently without blocking the main server thread. Each client is handled by a dedicated thread, allowing simultaneous message reading and broadcasting across all clients, demonstrating a practical use of Java multithreading, particularly using the Thread class to manage concurrency. The clients communicate with the server by sending messages which are then relayed to all other active clients, enabling real-time group chatting. The application is designed with a simple console-based user interface, and no external databases or persistent storage systems are involved since the communication is purely in-memory and real-time. The underlying platform is cross-compatible with major operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS, as long as Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed. This system does not use cloud platforms or external data services, relying solely on local sockets for communication, making it ideal for LAN-based or localhost-based demonstrations of networking concepts. The data flow is straightforward — clients send textual messages to the server, the server reads them, and then distributes them to all other connected clients, acting as a message broker in real time. The application is ideal for educational purposes, especially in demonstrating core Java concepts like input/output streams, thread management, inter-thread communication, and network programming fundamentals. Error handling is included to manage client disconnections and ensure that resources like sockets and streams are closed gracefully. The simplicity of the design allows future scalability where features like usernames, private messages, GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX, or even integration with databases like MySQL or MongoDB for logging chats can be incorporated. The entire system is built with a focus on core Java, without using external libraries, showcasing the power of Java’s standard library to build a fully functional networked application. Through this project, learners and developers gain hands-on experience with fundamental networking concepts and multithreading in Java, making it a strong addition to both academic portfolios and practical software engineering experience. Ultimately, the Multithreaded Chat Application demonstrates how multiple clients can exchange messages simultaneously in a networked environment, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience through efficient thread management and socket-based data transmission.
